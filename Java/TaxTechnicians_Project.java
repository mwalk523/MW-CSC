Description: Source code for our final project, a tax calculator. This program will read user input for a purchase, calculate the tax, 
and then present with the total price. Finally, the calculator will compare this price with the user's budget and tell them whether it is over or under. If 
the purchase is over the budget, user will be instructed to adjust their budget to a suitable amount
